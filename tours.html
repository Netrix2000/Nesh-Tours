            <p>
                Welcome to Entebbe the gateway between Uganda and the rest of the world. Popularly known for hosting the National Airport of the country, Entebbe was once the capital city of Uganda until the status was transfered to Kampala for strategic reasons. Regardless, it is still second to Kampala and its the President's residential area where the State House (National Presidential Home) is located.

Entebbe is best known for First Class Accomodation services and its security is next to none. You will also enjoy the beaches and cools winds from the Lake Victoria while in Entebbe. 

It is also hosts a wild life research center and its museum for specifically wild life species of the African continent.
